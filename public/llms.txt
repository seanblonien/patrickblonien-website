## About

My primary research interests lie in financial market design and the role of information in financial markets. I use dynamic models to evaluate the efficiency of different market structures and trading mechanisms. I am also interested in applying structural models to estimate the information content embedded in trades and recommendations. Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon University, I completed a Ph.D. in Finance at Rice University and hold a bachelor’s degree from Baylor University.
