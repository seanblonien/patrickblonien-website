Project: ‚ÄúPatrick Blonien ‚Äì Personal Academic Website‚Äù

Goal:
- Build a personal academic website for Patrick Blonien, Assistant Professor of
  Finance at Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business.
- Pages: Home and Research.
- Tech: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, next/font,
  pre-rendered static pages for all routes. Vercel deployment.
- Design: Finance-professor aesthetic; clean, credible, and fast.

Requirements:
- Layout:
  - Sticky top navbar: left = site name (‚ÄúPatrick Blonien‚Äù), right = links
    [Home, Research]. Active link style.
  - Footer with 3 columns:
    - Contact: email and physical address
    - Links: social links (e.g., Google Scholar, SSRN, Twitter/ùïè, LinkedIn)
    - Affiliations: CMU site directory link(s) and Tepper faculty directory link
  - Max content width ~1140‚Äì1280px, generous white space.
- Home Page:
  - Hero section with name, title, current position at Carnegie Mellon
    University, Tepper School of Business, and a hero portrait image.
  - Short research focus paragraph (placeholder if none provided).
  - Primary CTAs: ‚ÄúView Research‚Äù and ‚ÄúDownload CV‚Äù.
- Research Page:
  - Static list of Working Papers / Publications (single list is fine).
  - Each paper card includes:
    - Title
    - Authors list
    - Journal/venue label and year (or status like ‚ÄúR&R‚Äù / ‚ÄúForthcoming‚Äù)
    - Collapsible abstract (closed by default)
    - Action links with helpful icons: Paper (PDF/url), Slides, BibTeX,
      Presentations, Media, Code & Data, External profile (e.g., SSRN/GS)
- Accessibility:
  - Keyboard focus styles, aria-expanded for collapsible abstract,
    semantic landmarks (header/main/footer/nav), alt text for images.
- Responsiveness:
  - Mobile-first, stack layout on small screens.
  - Navbar collapses to a simple menu button on <md (optional); if not, keep a
    simple inline nav that wraps.
- Theming:
  - Light mode primary color = CMU red rgb(196, 18, 48).
  - Neutral grays elsewhere; high contrast
- Typography:
  - Body: Open Sans (next/font/google).
  - Headings: Merriweather (or Libre Baskerville) for a scholarly feel.
- Copy:
  - Keep professional, concise, neutral. Placeholder text where needed.

Data & Types:
- A type-safe JSON-literal‚Äìbacked module for research papers; easy to append.
- Use TypeScript const assertions and ‚Äúsatisfies‚Äù to enforce schema.
- Schema:
  - ResearchPaper:
    - id: string (slug)
    - title: string
    - authors: string[] (order matters)
    - venue?: string (journal/venue/status label)
    - year?: number
    - abstract?: string
    - tags?: string[]
    - links?: Array<{
        type: "paper" | "slides" | "bibtex" | "presentation" | "media" |
              "code" | "data" | "external";
        label?: string; // override default label
        url: string;
      }>
- Keep data local (no remote fetch). Export a list: papers[].

Interactions:
- Collapsible abstract with smooth height animation and aria attributes.
- Link icons: use lucide-react or heroicons; ensure external links open in new
  tab with rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Optional filter/search (not required).

Code constraints:
- Next.js 15 app dir structure with static generation (no server calls).
- Tailwind for styling; minimal custom CSS.
- Fonts via next/font/google.
- Icons via lucide-react.
- No extra UI libraries unless necessary
- Prettier formatting; logical Tailwind class ordering.
- SEO: use Next.js Metadata API for title, description, open graph, canonical.
- Static export-friendly where possible; ensure build-time data import.

Deliverables:
- Pages:
  - app/page.tsx (Home)
  - app/research/page.tsx (Research)
  - app/layout.tsx (root layout with fonts, metadata, navbar, footer)
- Components:
  - components/NavBar.tsx
  - components/Footer.tsx
  - components/Hero.tsx
  - components/ResearchList.tsx
  - components/ResearchCard.tsx
  - components/Collapse.tsx (for abstract)
  - components/IconLink.tsx
- Data:
  - data/papers.ts (typed JSON-literal module)
  - data/site.ts (name, title, email, address, socials, affiliations)
- Styles/Config:
  - tailwind.config.ts with CMU red as primary
  - globals.css (basic resets and prose tweaks)
- README comment at top of each page with how to add papers (AI friendly) and deploy to Vercel.

Non-goals:
- No backend, auth, or CMS.
- No dynamic fetching; no databases.

Examples for reference:
